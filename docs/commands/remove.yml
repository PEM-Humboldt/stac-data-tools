    description: |      
      - This command removes the collection from both:
          - The STAC catalog
          - Azure Blob Storage
      - The operation cannot be undone
      - The collection name parameter (-c/--collection) is required
      - Make sure to have proper backup before removing collections
      - Ensure you have the correct permissions in both STAC and Azure

      - Validate the collection name before removal
      - Consider creating a backup before removing important collections
      - Double-check the collection name to avoid accidental deletions
