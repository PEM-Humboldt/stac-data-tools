  - title: "General Setup"
    description: |      
      - The collection folder must be placed in the `input` directory.
      - The input folder must contain:

          - A `collection.json` file that describes the collection
          - The corresponding layer files (.tif)

      - The `collection.json` must follow the specification described in `spec/collection.md`.
  - title: "Command Behavior"
    description: |
      - This command validates without uploading or modifying any data.
      - If no collection name is provided with `-c`, the `id` from collection.json will be used.
      - The command performs comprehensive validation of the collection structure.
      - Use this command before creating/updating collections to ensure data integrity.
